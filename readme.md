## :telescope: Overview

  [üè† Homepage](https://github.com/lucas-lm/DevMeet)

  > Note: This project was proposed as a challenge by [Rafaella Ballerini](https://github.com/rafaballerini)'s tech [community](https://discord.gg/ballerini). See the prototype on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/UgZj1C1DWJlVftvMLz1Aq9/Dev-Meet?node-id=1%3A476).

  DevMeet is an mobile app created with React Native to find the next tech events online.

  There you can see the next events available and check information about them, like the date, the name and description. You can also navigate through the event's screen on app, where you find more information about that, like a timer (countdown) to the event and links to event's webpage itself.

  In Event's screen you can also copy/open the link and subscribe to get a notification when it starts (Vibration + Alert).
